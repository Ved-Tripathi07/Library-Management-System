# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a Python-based command-line application that allows users to manage a library's book inventory and user accounts. This system provides features for creating user accounts, adding books, viewing available books, and more.

## Features

- Create User Accounts: Users can register by providing their name, age, username, and a password that meets specific guidelines (uppercase letter, digit, and special character).

- Add Books: Librarians can add new books to the library's inventory, including the title, author, and availability status.

- View Available Books: Users can see a list of currently available books in the library.

## Requirements

To run this Library Management System, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (for data handling)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vedtripathi07/library-management-system.git


1. Navigate to the project directory:
cd library-management-system

2. Run the application:
python main.py

Usage

Upon running the application, you will be presented with a menu where you can choose various options, such as creating user accounts, adding books, and viewing available books.

Passwords for user accounts must meet specific criteria (uppercase letter, digit, and special character).

Data, including user accounts and book inventory, is saved to CSV files (users.csv and books.csv) to ensure data persistence between sessions.
